# ieeextreme-scrumbags

These are our team's solutions to the problems from [IEEEXtreme 10.0][ieeex 10].

Just because there is code doesn't mean its 100% correct. Sometime it'll only be
91% correct.

## License?

Turns out all the entries submitted during IEEEXtreme 10.0 become the property
of IEEE, so I suppose these solutions belong to them.

The problem statements belong entirely to IEEEXtreme, they were simply
copy-and-pasted and had some Markddown formatting put back in.
